                <h5>First, think about why you’re looking for a tutor. Depending on your goal, use filters to find your perfect tutor faster:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose the subject you want to study</li>
                    <li>Set your comfortable price per hour</li>
                    <li>If you have preferences for a specific accent, select tutor’s country, or filter by native speakers</li>
                    <li>Specify the time when you want to learn</li>
                    <li>If you have a specific need, like lessons for kids or Business English, use the ‘Specialties’ filter to narrow tutors by areas of expertise.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After applying filters, you’ll see a list of tutors to choose from. Our ranking algorithm considers all your filter preferences and puts the best tutors on top. Even new tutors can come on top if they fit your needs — they can be a great choice, too!
                </p>

                <h4>Here are some more tips to help you choose:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> Watch tutor videos to hear their pronunciation and understand their personality a bit.</li>
                    <li> Open the tutor profile by clicking on their name. You’ll learn more about the tutor's experience and teaching style.</li>
                    <li> Check reviews and ratings from other students to make an informed choice.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Let’s look at how you can pay for lessons on Uswa.</h4>
                <p>
                    First, you buy your trial lesson with a tutor to see if you like them. Tutor price for trial and next lessons is the same. If you like the tutor, you can then buy a set of hours with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your tutor will help you understand how many hours per week or month you’ll need to reach your goals. The more hours you buy, the bigger the discount from Uswa.
                </p>
                <h5>A few more things to keep in mind:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you need to switch tutors, you can easily transfer the hours you've bought with the help of the ‘Transfer hours’ feature. You can also request a refund of your unused hours.</li>
                    <li>If you don’t like your trial lesson, we’ll give you a free replacement with any new tutor of your choice, at any price. We’re sure there’s a perfect tutor for you on Uswa!</li>
                    <li>You can cancel or reschedule any lesson for free up to 4 hours before it starts.</li>
                    <li>Your trial lesson is 1 hour. Your next lessons can last from 30 mins to 3h 30mins — up to you and your tutor! You choose the date and time that best works for you</li>
                    <li>You can pay for lessons with a bank card, PayPal or Apple Pay.</li>
                </ul>
               
            </div>
